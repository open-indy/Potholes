pull in traffic data
pull in pothole data

split the map up into a geocode grid
plot all the potholes into that grid and give it a relative density rating 1-10
plot all the accidents into that grid and give it a relative density rating of 1-10

coorelate those two heatmaps and show where there are the most accidents and where there are the most potholes
the number of accidents isn't a perfect representation of traffic, there's more at play than that
but number of cars is undeniably one component of number of accidents and number of accidents suggests
overall danger of that area. and potholes only add to the danger with swerving and whatnot

pull a full number of records
find a number of requests
async call all the latlng records for that range and add them as they come in
create controls to toggle which view you're looking at
